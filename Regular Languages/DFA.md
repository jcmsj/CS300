* __Deterministic Finite Automata__ - Machine that recognizes members of a regular language.
* M = (Q, $\sum$, [$\delta$](../Greek%20Symbols.md), i, F) <br>
* where:  
        
        Q - finite set of states
        ∑ - finite set of input alphabet
        δ - machine program
        i - initial state
        F - set of final states
